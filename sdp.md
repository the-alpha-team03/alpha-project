# Software Development Plan

## Administrivia
*  Weekly meetings will be conducted either through Zoom or in-person conferences. Minutes of these meetings will be recorded and shared via Zoom following each session. 

The main mode of communication will be Zoom meetings/in-person for discussions and updates, while GitHub will serve as the platform for formal communication and sharing documents.

All project documentation, such as requirements, design documents, and user manuals, will be stored and administered through GitHub, ensuring accessibility for all team members.

## Development Methodology
* The development methodolgy which we will be using in our project is Agile which allows for flexibility, adaptation to changing requirements, and continuous improvement throughout the project's duration.
